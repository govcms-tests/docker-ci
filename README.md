## Usage

### Building Images

You can build these images using the provided Dockerfiles. For example, to build the PHP-Apache image for PHP 8.2, use the following command:

```bash
docker build --tag govcmstesting/php:8.2-apache .
```

### Releasing Images

To release these images, you can use Docker Buildx, which allows you to build and push images for multiple platforms. For instance, to release the PHP-Apache image for PHP 8.2 for various platforms, use the following command:

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/arm/v7,linux/arm/v8 --tag govcmstesting/php:8.2-apache --push .
```

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/arm/v7,linux/arm/v8 --tag govcmstesting/php:8.2-cli --push .
```

Make sure to configure Docker Buildx appropriately to work with multiple platforms.

### Pulling Images

You can pull these images from a container registry using docker pull. For instance, to pull the PHP 8.2 Apache image, use the following command:

```bash
docker pull govcmstesting/php:8.2-apache
```

```bash
docker pull govcmstesting/php:8.2-cli
```
